Python’s Dictionaries: An Introduction (and a couple of tricks)
------

The Python programming language is known for its ease of use and “batteries included” philosophy, having a built-in suite of useful features. One of the “killer” features are dictionaries. Python’s dictionaries, aka dicts, are key-value pairs for the fast lookup of data. They are core to the Python programming language and one of the most useful tools for any kind of programming. 

This hands-on tutorial will be a general introduction to Python’s dicts with a focus how to use them to accomplish common programming tasks. 

The second half of the talk will cover tips n’ tricks, extensions, and common gotchas for dicts. This tutorial is aimed at novice programmers but intermediate programmers will learn something. 

Please bring any kind of laptop so you can follow along.
